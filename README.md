## Overview

This project contains the open hardware design files for the Seeed Studio's NVIDIA Jetson hardware series, including reComputer, ans reServer carrier boards based on **Jetson Nano, Jetson Xavier NX, and Jetson Orin**. 

It includes the BRD, DSN circuit design source files, and visualized PDF schematic files for the following five carrier boards: [reComputer industrial J201](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/OSHW-Jetson-Series/tree/main/reComputer%20Jetson%20baseboard/reComputer%20Industrial%20J201), [reComputer J202](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/OSHW-Jetson-Series/tree/main/reComputer%20Jetson%20baseboard/reComputer%20J202), [reComputer J401](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/OSHW-Jetson-Series/tree/main/reComputer%20Jetson%20baseboard/reComputer%20J401), [reServer industrial J401](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/OSHW-Jetson-Series/tree/main/reServer%20Jetson%20baseboard/reServer%20Industrial%20J401), and [reServer J2032](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/OSHW-Jetson-Series/tree/main/reServer%20Jetson%20baseboard/reServer%20J2032).


The design files were preapared in Cadence **Allegro 17.4**.

## Project structure 
The main directory contains subdirectories for reComputer and reServer hardware open-source files, a **LICENSE** file, and a **README** file. The subdirectories reComputer and reServer provide the **BRD**, **DSN** circuit design source files, and visualized **PDF** schematic files for the following five carrier boards. 

Specifically, 
- the **BRD** and **PDF** files are placed in the each product's **/Layout** subdirectory, 
- the **DSN** files in the each product's **/Schematic** subdirectory.
