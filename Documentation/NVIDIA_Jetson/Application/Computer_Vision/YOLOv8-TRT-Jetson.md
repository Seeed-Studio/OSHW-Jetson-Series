# Deploy YOLOv8 on NVIDIA Jetson using TensorRT

This wiki guide explains how to deploy a YOLOv8 model into NVIDIA Jetson Platform and perform inference using TensorRT. Here we use TensorRT to maximize the inference performance on the Jetson platform.

Different computer vision tasks will be introduced here such as:

- Object Detection
- Image Segmentation
- Image Classification
- Pose Estimation
- Object Tracking

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu Host PC (native or VM using VMware Workstation Player)
- [reComputer Jetson](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-J4012-p-5586.html) or any other NVIDIA Jetson device running JetPack 5.1.1 or higher

> [!NOTE]
> This wiki has been tested and verified on a [reComputer J4012](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-J4012-p-5586.html) and reComputer Industrial J4012[https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-Industrial-J4012-p-5684.html] powered by NVIDIA Jetson orin NX 16GB module

## Flash JetPack to Jetson

Now you need to make sure that the Jetson device is flashed with a [JetPack](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) system. You can either use NVIDIA SDK Manager or command-line to flash JetPack to the device.

For Seeed Jetson-powered devices flashing guides, please refer to the below links:

- [Jetson AGX Orin 32GB H01 Kit](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Jetson_AGX_Orin_32GB_H01_Flash_Jetpack)

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to Flash JetPack version 5.1.1 because that is the version we have verified for this wiki

## Deploy YOLOV8 to Jetson in One Line of Code

After you flash the Jetson device with JetPack, you can simply run the below commands to run YOLOv8 models.  This will first download and install the necessary packages, dependencies, setup the environment and download pretrained models from YOLOv8 to perform object detection, Image segmentation, pose estimation and image classifications tasks!

```sh
wget files.seeedstudio.com/YOLOv8-Jetson.py && python YOLOv8-Jetson.py
```

> [!NOTE]
> The source code for the above script can be found [here](https://github.com/yuyoujiang/Run-YOLOv8-in-One-Line-on-Jetson)

## Use Pre-trained models

The fastest way to get started with YOLOv8 is to use pre-trained models provided by YOLOv8. However, these are PyTorch models and therefore will only utilize the CPU when inferencing on the Jetson. If you want the best performance of these models on the Jetson while running on the GPU, you can export the PyTorch models to TensorRT by following this section of the wiki.

Object tracking is a task that involves identifying the location and class of objects, then assigning a unique ID to that detection in video streams.

Basically the output of object tracking is the same as object detection with an added object ID.

You can choose your desired model based on object detection/ image segmentation and execute the below command to run inference on an video

```sh
yolo track model=yolov8n.pt source="https://youtu.be/Zgi9g1ksQHc"
```

Here for model, you can change to either yolov8n.pt, yolov8s.pt, yolov8m.pt, yolov8l.pt, yolov8x.pt, yolov8n-seg.pt, yolov8s-seg.pt, yolov8m-seg.pt, yolov8l-seg.pt, yolov8x-seg.pt, and it will download the relavant pre-trained model

You can also connect a webcam and execute the below command

```sh
yolo track model=yolov8n.pt source="0"
```

## Use TensorRT to Improve Inference Speed

As we mentioned before, if you want to improve the inference speed on the Jetson running YOLOv8 models, you first need to convert the original PyTorch models to TensorRT models.

Follow the steps below to convert YOLOv8 PyTorch models to TensorRT models.

> [!NOTE]
> This works for all four computer vision tasks that we have mentioned before

- **Step 1.** Execute the export command by specifying the model path

```sh
yolo export model=<path_to_pt_file> format=engine device=0
```

For example:

```sh
yolo export model=yolov8n.pt format=engine device=0
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you, encouter an error about cmake, you can ignore it. Please be patient until the TensorRT export is finished. It might take a few minutes

After the TensorRT model file (.engine) is created, you will see the output as follows

![image](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV8-TRT/1.jpg
)

- **Step 2.** If you want to pass additional arguments, you can do so by following the below table


    Key
    Value
    Description



    imgsz
    640
    Image size as scalar or (h, w) list, i.e. (640, 480)


    half
    False
    FP16 quantization


    dynamic
    False
    Dynamic axes


    simplify
    False
    Simplify model


    workspace
    4
    Workspace size (GB)


For example, if you want to convert your PyTorch model into a TensorRT model in FP16 quantization, execute as

```sh
yolo export model=yolov8n.pt format=engine half=True device=0
```

Once the model is exported successfully, you can directly replace this model with **model=** argument inside **predict** command of **yolo** when running all 4 tasks of detection, classification, segmentation, pose estimation.

For example, with object detection:

```sh
yolo detect predict model=yolov8n.engine source='0' show=True
```

## Bring Your Own AI Model

### Data Collection and Labelling

If you have a specific AI application and want to bring your own AI model that is suitable for your application, you can collect your own dataset, label them and then train using YOLOv8.

If you do not want to collect data by yourself, you can also choose public datasets which are readily available. You can download a number of publically available datasets such as the [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org), [Pascal VOC dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC) and much more. [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com) is a recommended platform which provides a wide-range of datasets and it has [90,000+ datasets with 66+ million images](https://blog.roboflow.com/computer-vision-datasets-and-apis) available for building computer vision models. Also, you can simply search open-source datasets on Google and choose from a variety of datasets available.

If you have your own dataset and want to annotate the images, we recommend you to use the annotation tool provided by [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com). Please follow [this part of the wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/YOLOv5-Object-Detection-Jetson/#annotate-dataset-using-roboflow) to learn more about it. You can also follow [this guide](https://docs.roboflow.com/annotate/use-roboflow-annotate) from Roboflow about annotation.

### Training

Here we have 3 methods to train a model.

1. First way would be to use [Ultralytics HUB](https://ultralytics.com/hub). You can easily integrate Roboflow into Ultralytics HUB so that all your Roboflow projects will be readily available for training. Here it offers a Google Colab notebook to easily start the training process and also view the training progress in real-time.

2. Second way would be to use a Google Colab workspace created by us to make the training process easier. Here we use Roboflow API to download the dataset from Roboflow project.

3. Third way would be to use a local PC for the training process. Here you need to make sure you have a powerful enough GPU and also need to manually download the dataset.

![image](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV8-TRT/33.jpg
)

- **Step 25** After the training is finished, you will see the following output on Google Colab

![image](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV8-TRT/34.jpg
)

- **Step 26** Now go back to Ultralytics HUB, go to **Preview** tab and upload a test image to check how the trained model is performing

![image](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV8-TRT/35.jpg
)

- **Step 26** Finally go to **Deploy** tab and download the trained model in the format you prefer to inference with YOLOv8. Here we have chosen PyTorch.

![image](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV8-TRT/36.png
)

Now you can use this downloaded model with the tasks that we have explained in this wiki before. You just need to replace the model file with your model.

For example:

```
yolo detect predict model=<your_model.pt> source='0' show=True
```

#### Option

Here we use a Google Colaboratory environment to perform training on the cloud. Furthermore, we use Roboflow api within Colab to easily download our dataset.

- **Step 1.** Click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/lakshanthad/9fbe33058cb7cab49ac8fc345143d849/yolov5-training-for-jetson.ipynb) to open an already prepared Google Colab workspace and go through the steps mentioned in the workspace

)

After the training is done, you will see an output as follows:

![image](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV8-TRT/40.jpg
)

- **Step 2.** Under Files tab, if you navigate to `runs/train/exp/weights`, you will see a file called **best.pt**. This is the generated model from training. Download this file and copy to your Jetson device because this is the model we are going to use later for inferencing on the Jetson device.

)

Now you can use this downloaded model with the tasks that we have explained in this wiki before. You just need to replace the model file with your model.

For example:

```
yolo detect predict model=<your_model.pt> source='0' show=True
```

#### Option

Here you can use a PC with a Linux OS for training. We have used an Ubuntu 20.04 PC for this wiki.

- **Step 1.** Install pip if you do not have pip in your system

```sh
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
```

- **Step 2.** Install Ultralytics along with dependencies

```sh
pip install ultralytics
```

- **Step 3.** On Roboflow, inside your project, go to **Versions**, select **Export Dataset**, select **Format** as **YOLOv8**, choose **download zip to computer** and click **Continue**

![image](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV8-TRT/42.jpg
)

- **Step 4.** Extract the downloaded zip file

- **Step 5.** Execute the following to start training. Here you need to replace **path_to_yaml** with the .yaml file location which is inside the extracted zip file before

```sh
yolo train data=<path_to_yaml> model=yolov8s.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640 batch=-1
```

> [!NOTE]
> Here the image size is set to 640x640. We use batch-size as -1 because that will automatically determine the best batch size. You can also change epoch according to your preference. Here you can change the pre-trained model to any detect, segment, classify, pose model.

After the training is done, you will see an output as follows:

![image](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV8-TRT/43.png
)

- **Step 6.** Under **runs/detect/train/weights**, you will see a file called **best.pt**. This is the generated model from training. Download this file and copy to your Jetson device because this is the model we are going to use later for inferencing on the Jetson device.

![image](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV8-TRT/44.png
)

Now you can use this downloaded model with the tasks that we have explained in this wiki before. You just need to replace the model file with your model.

For example:

```
yolo detect predict model=<your_model.pt> source='0' show=True
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Preparation

We have done performance benchmarks for all computer vision tasks supported by YOLOv8 running on reComputer J4012/ reComputer Industrial J4012 powered by NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX 16GB module.

Included in the samples directory is a command-line wrapper tool called [trtexec](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/developer-guide/index.html#trtexec). trtexec is a tool to use TensorRT without having to develop your own application. The trtexec tool has three main purposes:

- Benchmarking networks on random or user-provided input data.
- Generating serialized engines from models.
- Generating a serialized timing cache from the builder.

Here we can use trtexec tool to quickly benchmark the models with different parameter. But first of all, you need to have an onnx model and we can genrate this onnx model by using ultralytics yolov8.

- **Step 1.** Build ONNX using:

```sh
yolo mode=export model=yolov8s.pt format=onnx
```

- **Step 2.** Build engine file using trtexec as follows:

```sh
cd /usr/src/tensorrt/bin
./trtexec --onnx=<path_to_onnx_file> --saveEngine=<path_to_save_engine_file>
```

For example:

```sh
./trtexec --onnx=/home/nvidia/yolov8s.onnx --saveEngine=/home/nvidia/yolov8s.engine
```

This will output performance results as follows along with a generated .engine file. By default it will convert ONNX to an TensorRT optimized file in FP32 precision and you can see the output as follows

![image](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/YOLOV8-TRT/46.jpg
)

If you want **FP16** precision which offers better performance than **FP32**, you can execute the above command as follows

```sh
./trtexec --onnx=/home/nvidia/yolov8s.onnx --fp16 --saveEngine=/home/nvidia/yolov8s.engine
```

However, if you want **INT8** precision which offers better performance than **FP16**, you can execute the above command as follows

```sh
./trtexec --onnx=/home/nvidia/yolov8s.onnx --int8 --saveEngine=/home/nvidia/yolov8s.engine
```

### Results

Below we summarize the results that we get from all the four computer vision tasks running on reComputer J4012/ reComputer Industrial J4012.

## Manual Set Up of YOLOv8 for NVIDIA Jetson

If the one-line script we mentioned before has some errors, you can go through the below steps one-by-one to prepare the Jetson device with YOLOv8.

### Install Ultralytics Package

- **Step 1.** Access the terminal of Jetson device, install pip and upgrade it

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip -y
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

- **Step 2.**  Install Ultralytics package

```sh
pip3 install ultralytics
```

- **Step 3.**  Upgrade numpy version to latest

```sh
pip3 install numpy -U
```

- **Step 4.** Reboot the device

```sh
sudo reboot
```

### Uninstall Torch and Torchvision

The above ultralytics installation will install Torch and Torchvision. However, these 2 packages installed via pip are not compatible to run on Jetson platform wwhich is based on **ARM aarch64 architecture**. Therefore we need to manually install pre-built PyTorch pip wheel and compile/ install Torchvision from source.

```sh
pip3 uninstall torch torchvision
```

### Install PyTorch and Torchvision

Visit [this page](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/pytorch-for-jetson) to access all the PyTorch and Torchvision links.

Here are some of the versions supported by JetPack 5.0 and above.

**PyTorch v2.0.0**

Supported by JetPack 5.1 (L4T R35.2.1) / JetPack 5.1.1 (L4T R35.3.1) with Python 3.8

**file_name:** torch-2.0.0+nv23.05-cp38-cp38-linux_aarch64.whl
**URL:** https://nvidia.box.com/shared/static/i8pukc49h3lhak4kkn67tg9j4goqm0m7.whl

**PyTorch v1.13.0**

Supported by JetPack 5.0 (L4T R34.1) / JetPack 5.0.2 (L4T R35.1) / JetPack 5.1 (L4T R35.2.1) / JetPack 5.1.1 (L4T R35.3.1) with Python 3.8

**file_name:** torch-1.13.0a0+d0d6b1f2.nv22.10-cp38-cp38-linux_aarch64.whl
**URL:** https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/jp/v502/pytorch/torch-1.13.0a0+d0d6b1f2.nv22.10-cp38-cp38-linux_aarch64.whl

- **Step 1.** Install torch according to your JetPack version in the following format
pip3

```sh
wget <URL> -O <file_name>
pip3 install <file_name>
```

For example, here we are running **JP5.1.1** and therefore we choose **PyTorch v2.0.0**

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y libopenblas-base libopenmpi-dev
wget https://nvidia.box.com/shared/static/i8pukc49h3lhak4kkn67tg9j4goqm0m7.whl -O torch-2.0.0+nv23.05-cp38-cp38-linux_aarch64.whl
pip3 install torch-2.0.0+nv23.05-cp38-cp38-linux_aarch64.whl
```

- **Step 2.** Install torchvision depending on the version of PyTorch that you have installed. For example, we chose PyTorch v2.0.0, which means, we need to choose Torchvision v0.15.2

```sh
sudo apt install -y libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/vision torchvision
cd torchvision
git checkout v0.15.2
python3 setup.py install --user
```

Here is a list of the corresponding torchvision version that you need to install according to the PyTorch version:

- PyTorch v2.0.0 - torchvision v0.15
- PyTorch v1.13.0 - torchvision v0.14

If you want a more detailed list, please check [this link](https://github.com/pytorch/vision).

### Install ONNX and Downgrade Numpy

This is only needed if you want to convert the PyTorch models to TensorRT

- **Step 1.** Install ONNX which is a requirement

```sh
pip3 install onnx
```

- **Step 2.** Downgrade to lower version of Numpy to fix an error

```sh
pip3 install numpy==1.20.3
```
